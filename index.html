        <h2><b>What is this IP Address "169.254.169.254"?</b></h2>

	<p>I was going through the documentation of AWS when I found a totally new thing which says that an amazon instance may access instance-specific metadata as well as data supplied when launching the instance by making a query at http://169.254.169.254/. At first read, I felt how it is possible that all instances can get its own specific metadata by hitting the same URL.</p>

<p>So I logged into two of the instances and queried the same thing by randomly picking one of the metadata called user-data as given in the documentation. The result shocked me once again.</p>
<pre><code>
pradeep@nat-host-1b$ curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
nat-host-1b
pradeep@nat-host-1c$ curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
nat-host-1c
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
